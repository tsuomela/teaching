# adding data from other files

```{r}
flood.data <- read.csv("data/flood_deaths_annual_number.csv", header = T)

flood.data <- gather(flood.data, key = year, value = n_deaths, -geo)

flood.data$year <- substr(flood.data$year, 2, 5)
flood.data$year <- as.integer(flood.data$year)
```

Showing totals by year

```{r}
year.flood.totals <- flood.data %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarise(n = sum(n_deaths))

ggplot(year.flood.totals,
  aes(x = year, y = n)) +
  geom_col()
```

Combining the columns to add flood data

```{r}
merged.data <- merge(gapminder, flood.data, by = c("country", "year"), all = T)

```
