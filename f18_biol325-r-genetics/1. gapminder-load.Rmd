title: "Gapminder - loading data and viewing the structure"
output: html_notebook

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code.  The notebook will use data from the [Gapminder project](https://www.gapminder.org/).

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

# The Gapminder Data

First we will load the gapminder library and the data.frame it contains.

Then you can find information about the gapminder dataset by viewing the documentation.

```{r}
library(gapminder)
data("gapminder")
help("gapminder")
```

The datset contains the following fields:

Format

The main data frame gapminder has 1704 rows and 6 variables:

* country = factor with 142 levels
* continent = factor with 5 levels
* year = ranges from 1952 to 2007 in increments of 5 years
* lifeExp = life expectancy at birth, in years
* pop = population

You may also explore the dataset to find out more about its structure using the following commands

```{r}
str(gapminder) # structure of the data.frame
glimpse(gapminder) # this is only available from the dplyr package
names(gapminder) # names of the variables in the data.frame
```

You can also view the content in various ways

```{r}
head(gapminder) # shows the first 6 rows of the data.frame
tail(gapminder) # shows the last 6 rows of the data.frame
```

We can also display some summary information about the data.frame using the summary and table commands.

```{r}
summary(gapminder)
table(gapminder$continent) # note the $ sign to refer to a single variable in the data.frame
```

# Basic graphical data exploration with graphs

## Histogram

A histogram shows the distribution of a single variable, usually across a horizontal axis.  Observations are  grouped into _bins_ in order to show the distribution.

```{r}
ggplot(gapminder,
       aes(gdpPercap)) +
  geom_histogram()
```

## Box Plot

A box plot is useful for summarizing the distribution of a continuous variable in comparison to a categorical variable.  It also dispays key values such as median, interquartile range, and outliers.

```{r}
ggplot(gapminder,
       aes(x = continent, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```


## Scatter Plot

Let's create a scatter plot that shows lifeExp v. pop

Scatter plots work best for continuous numerical variables.

```{r}
ggplot(gapminder,
       aes(x = lifeExp, y = pop)) +
  geom_point()
```
