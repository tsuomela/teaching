# Welcome to R Notebook

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

## Loading your Libraries and Installing Packages

```{r}
install.packages(c("ggplot2", "dplyr", "tidyverse"))
library(ggplot2)
```

# Variables and Objects

```{r}
v1 <- c(1, 2, 3)
v2 <- "Todd Suomela"
str(v1)
str(v2)
```

Learning about your objects. Some common functions.

* str
* length
* class

```{r}
length(v1)
length(v2)
class(v1)
class(v2)
```

# Reading Data from a File

A typical file structure.

* header = usually the first row of the file contains the names of the variables that have been observed
* rows = each row usually contains an observation
* separator = data is usually separated by some type of character (tab, comma) or is in a file format (Excel) that contains columns

```{r}
read.table("data/Getting-to-know-you_results.txt", header = T, sep = "\t")
getting.d <- read.table("data/Getting-to-know-you_results.txt", header = T, sep = "\t")
```

# Getting a Summary of the File You Loaded

You can find out additional information about the object you just created by asking R.

```{r}
length(getting.d)
names(getting.d) # this gives you the names of the columns
summary(getting.d) # this gives you a summary: for numeric values you get min, 1st qu, median, mean, 3rd qu, and max; for factors you get a count of occurrences
```

# Let's Get Ready to Create a Graph

To create a graph we will be using a package / library called: ggplot2

In this example we begin by calling the function (ggplot),
then we tell it which data to map / graph (aes),
finally we give it a format for the graph (geom)

```{r}
ggplot(getting.d,
       aes(x = Which.is.your.primary.form.of.social.media.)) +
  geom_bar()

```

```{r}
names(getting.d)
ggplot(getting.d,
       aes(x = Year)) +
  geom_bar()
```


Let's clean up the graph to make it easier to read and more presentable.

We can add display elements to the graph by adding more lines with specific function calls.

Let's add a title.

```{r}
ggplot(getting.d,
       aes(Which.is.your.primary.form.of.social.media.)) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(title = "Primary Form of Social Media", x = "Platform Name")
```

What else could we change to make this graph more readable?

How might you go about finding a solution for this?
